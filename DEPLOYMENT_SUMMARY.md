## 🔧 Deployment Steps

### **1. Fix Vercel Environment Variables**

The error you're seeing is because Vercel needs these environment variables:

```bash
DATABASE_URL = postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_h9slZHJF6mur@ep-tiny-scene-ad8s3c18-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require

NEXTAUTH_URL = https://your-app-name.vercel.app

NEXTAUTH_SECRET = [generate with: openssl rand -base64 32]
```

**Set these in Vercel Dashboard:**
1. Go to your project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add each variable with Environment = "Production"
3. Redeploy

### **2. Database Setup**

Your database schema is ready. After deployment:

```bash
# Run migrations (if needed)
npm run db:migrate:prod

# Seed AI opponents
npm run db:seed
```

### **3. Test Deployment**

After fixing environment variables:
- ✅ User registration should work
- ✅ AI games should save stats
- ✅ Authentication should persist
- ✅ Ratings should update

## 📊 Features Working

## 🎯 Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Set environment variables in Vercel**
2. **Redeploy the application**
3. **Test user registration**
4. **Test AI game completion**
5. **Verify database connections**

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**

1. **"DATABASE_URL references Secret that does not exist"**
   - Set DATABASE_URL in Vercel environment variables

2. **NextAuth errors**
   - Set NEXTAUTH_URL to your production domain
   - Set NEXTAUTH_SECRET to a secure random string

3. **Database connection fails**
   - Verify Neon database is active
   - Check DATABASE_URL format

### **Testing Checklist:**
